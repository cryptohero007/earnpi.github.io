              Pi Network’s mining mechanism is simple and meritocratic: The more you contribute to the network in
              diverse ways, the higher your mining rate is. Please refer to the </i></b><a

                  <br> <span>In addition to mining everyday, you can boost your individual
                    mining rate
                    by doing one or more of the activities below. Keep in mind that the mining stops along with all
                    types of
                    mining rewards when a mining session is no longer active (that is, after the end of a 24-hour
                    mining
                    session and before you start another mining session on the app). Therefore, it’s best to set an
                    app
                    notification to remind you when it is time to start a new mining session.</span>

                        Security
                        Circle to maximize Security Circle rewards. Pi’s consensus algorithm relies on a global trust
                        graph,
                        which is aggregated from the millions of intertwining Security Circles of individual Pioneers.
                        Thus, a
                        Pioneer is given an additional mining boost for each new valid Security Circle connection, up to
                        5
                        such connections. </span><span>Each Security Circle member who remains
                        active adds a boost of 20% of the base rate (up to a maximum of 100%).</span><span> </span></li>

                        of the
                        base rate to your hourly mining rewards. There is no limit to the number of members you can add
                        to
                        your Referral Team. </span><span>This Referral Team rewards recognize

                        increase

                        internet, and are computed based on the reliability and accessibility of the Node you are
                        running.
                        Node rewards also apply to running nodes on the Testnet. Community nodes can run on the Mainnet
                        during
                        the Open Mainnet period (more information on the whitepaper draft linked above). </span></li>
